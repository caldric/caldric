## 👋 &nbsp;Hi there! I'm Claude

### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp;I love learning to build and building to learn, especially if it means solving real-world problems.\
🎓 &nbsp;I have a BS in math with a minor in stats and an associate in financial services. I've developed my programming knowledge by creating various software solutions professionally as a data analyst for over five years, and I supplemented that with General Assembly's intensive software engineering bootcamp.\
🌱 &nbsp;I'm currently learning software testing. Next on my list is Docker and solidifying my knowledge in data structures and algorithms.\
✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I love learning something new, snowboarding, or playing video games with my friends.\
💬 &nbsp;Feel free to reach out to me for a cofee chat (virtual or otherwise)!\
✉️ &nbsp;You can shoot me an email at claude@aldric.dev!\
📄 &nbsp;Here's my [resume](https://aldric.dev/resume_aldric_claude.pdf) for more details about me. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
